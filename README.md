#Natrual Language Processing of US Patent Information
This project is a topic based analysis of the abstracts of patents approved by the US patent office. The potential insights to gain from understanding who is patening what include but are not limited to industry trends, opposition research, and possible converging technologies.
The patent office has over 7 million patents as of the writing of this document with categories ranging over all currently patented techologies and methodologies. This is obviously too much for any person to absorb so by leveraging the power of NLP we can extract insights from this mass of data.
