7025|1817412|2255038|5755950|utility|1998-05-26| An improved method for stripping or removing tin or tin/lead plating materials from copper-based alloys is provided. This method is essentially a two-stage process whereby the bulk of the plating layer is removed in the first stage and the remaining intermetallic layer (i.e., the interface between the copper-based substrate and the plating materials) is removed in the second stage. The first stage uses an aqueous etchant solution containing either sulfuric acid and nitric or an alkane sulfonic acid and nitric acid. An aqueous immersion solution containing either sulfuric acid and copper (II) ions or an alkane sulfonic acid and copper (II) ions (which can form complexes with the alkane sulfonic acid such as copper mesylate) is used in the second stage to remove the remaining intermetallic layer. The copper-based substrate, after rinsing with water and is drying (if appropriate), can then be treated using conventional metal-recycling procedures. If desired, tin or tin/lead (as well as other components) can be recovered from the aqueous etchant and immersion solutions and, if desired, recycled. Recovered sulfonic acid (either sulfuric acid or alkane sulfonic acids) from the aqueous etchant and immersion solutions can also be recycled in the process. |Process for removing plating materials from copper-based substrates|A|29|0.0|0

The delivery system then moves the seed down to a lower discharge point and accelerates the seed horizontally rearward to a speed approximately equal to the forward travel speed of the seeding machine such that the seed, when discharged has a low or zero horizontal velocity relative to the ground. Rolling of the seed in the trench is thus reduced. Furthermore, as the seed only has a short drop from the outlet to the bottom of the seed trench, the seed has little vertical speed to induce bounce. The delivery system uses a brush belt to capture, move and accelerate the seed.

The programmable circuit of the present invention determines when, in an I/O access cycle, the resource addressing control (IOCHRDY) signal should be activated by an I/O mapped system resource. The present invention includes lost circuitry for determining whether a particular system resource operates best in a late IOCHRDY mode or an early IOCHRDY mode. The test logic will force the IOCHRDY signal to remain active for an extended period of time. By extending the deactivation time of the IOCHRDY signal far beyond the time at which the deactivation would normally occur, the responsiveness of a command strobe (IORD/IOWR) may be tested. If the deactivation of the command strobe IORD/IOWR follows the extended deactivation time of the IOCHRDY signal, the command strobe (IORD/IOWR) is properly responsive to the IOCHRDY signal and proper operation of the I/O access control logic is verified. If, however, the extended activation of the IOCHRDY signal causes the command strobe (IORD/IOWR) to deactivate prior to the deactivation of the IOCHRDY signal, a nonresponsive command strobe (IORD/IOWR) signal is present and thus a failure condition is detected. A processor-readable bit in a control register indicates a successful or unsuccessful IOCHRDY test condition. |Addressing control signal configuration in a computer system|A|21|0.0|0

If the input signal is a predetermined interlock condition, that signal is deemed to be the cause of the interlock trip, saved and displayed. If the input signal is the output of another gate, then the inputs to that gate are examined to determine which input signal caused that gate to switch state. This process is repeated until a predetermined interlock condition is found which has switched state. By knowing the structure of the interlock logic and knowing the state of logic signals outputted from the interlock logic, the determination is made and saved such that even if the predetermined interlock condition that caused the interlock trip subsequently changes state as a result of placing the device in a safe state, the cause of the interlock trip is ascertained and saved by this method. |Method for interlock tracing for discrete devices in a process control system|A|6|0.0|0

More particularly, an engine responsible for fetching native instructions from a memory subsystem (such as an EM fetch engine) is interfaced with an engine that processes emulated instructions (such as an x86 engine). This is achieved using a handshake protocol, whereby the x86 engine sends an explicit fetch request signal to the EM fetch engine along with a fetch address. The EM fetch engine then accesses the memory subsystem and retrieves a line of instructions for subsequent decode and execution. The EM fetch engine sends this line of instructions to the x86 engine along with an explicit fetch complete signal. The EM fetch engine also includes a fetch address queue capable of holding the fetch addresses before they are processed by the EM fetch engine. The fetch requests are processed such that more than one fetch request may be pending at the same time. If a pending fetch request is canceled due to a pipeline flush, then the fetch address queue is cleared and the pending fetch requests are canceled. The system also prevents macroinstruction (MIQ)-related stalls by using a speculative write pointer to control the issuance of fetch requests, thereby preventing the MIQ from becoming oversubscribed.|Method and apparatus for fetching instructions from the memory subsystem of a mixed architecture processor into a hardware emulation engine|B2|15|0.0|0

Specifically it is demonstrated that if the seismic events are planar in the t-xy domain, then in the f-xy domain they consist of predictable signals in the xy-plane for each frequency f. A crucial step of the 2-D spectral factorization is achieved through the helical coordinate transformation. In addition to the disclosed general algorithm for arbitrary coherent noise, a specialized algorithm for random noise is disclosed.

5261|1477292|1914918|5411526|utility|1995-05-02| The first embodiment of the present invention repositions the shunt thyristor used in the monophasic-waveform generator of the prior art so that it discharges the main capacitor through a series thyristor, thus increasing current through it briefly, rather than reducing current through it. The result of this arrangement is that the node between the series thyristor and the heart is pulled rapidly to a low voltage, causing the shunt switch to discharge the cardiac capacitance, as well as the main capacitance. The consequence is that discharging the cardiac capacitance requires a reversal of current in the heart, which enhances the heart-stimulating effect of the defibrillating waveform. The resulting true-voltage-pulse waveform has an efficacy approximating that of a biphasic waveform and is achieved with a circuit no more complex than that used to generate a monophasic waveform.
