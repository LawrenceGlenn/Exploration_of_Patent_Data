The limited access controller inhibits motor responses, such as by preventing motor operation, limiting available motor speeds, or allowing motor operation only in a vector that removes the golf cart from the limited access area, such as operation in reverse. Golf carts of a golf course communicate with a base station that updates the limited access map by defining limited access area perimeters and allowable actions within a limited access area and that directly commands allowable motor operations. For example, golf carts are prohibited from entering green areas, are restricted to golf cart paths during cart-path-only periods, and are restricted to reduced speeds in driving hazard areas.|Method and system for golf cart control|B2|20|0.0|1
7419|1834910|2272536|5773814|utility|1998-06-30| A sensor assembly and an optical image color scanner using the sensor assembly. The sensor assembly is of the type having three separate rows of optical sensors. Two of the three sensor rows have color filters and one is unfiltered (receptive to white light). For gray scale scanning, only the unfiltered (white) sensor row is used, thereby maximizing the speed of gray scale scanning. For color scanning, three color values are computed as a linear transformation of values from the two filtered and one unfiltered values. The linear transformation may be as simple as subtracting signals from the two filtered sensor rows from the signal from the unfiltered (white) sensor row. For color scanning, memory buffers are required for two of the three sensor output signals. For highest accuracy in color scanning, the exposure time for the white sensor row is reduced relative to the exposure time for the two filtered sensor rows. An optional white channel bandpass filter (passing all wavelengths within the human visual range and rejecting wavelengths outside the human visual range) provides improved accuracy if the light source has significant wavelengths outside the human visual range. |Sensor assembly providing gray scale and color for an optical image scanner|A|20|0.0|0

Acceleration or deceleration propulsion is obtained by expelling or ingesting atmospheric gas respectively. Consequently, propulsive working fluid expelled during accelerating forward propulsive maneuvers is automatically replenished during decelerating retro propulsive maneuvers. The refueling retro thrust is generated by a large diameter hypervelocity has inlet diffuser mounted at the front of the vehicle which scoops up atmospheric gas while traversing through the tenuous upper regions of a planet's atmosphere. The vehicle thereby transfers a portion of its momentum to the collected gas which was initially at rest in the atmosphere. This transfer of momentum generates a decelerating retro thrust by a reverse application of the theory of classical rocket propulsion. The collected gas is condensed, stored on-board the vehicle, and utilized as propulsive working fluid for generating forward propulsive accelerating thrust by expelling the gas at high velocity.

The method represents the geometric entities in terms of degrees of freedom and systematically satisfies the constraints reducing the degrees of freedom of the geometric entities. The method uses a number of specialized routines, called plan fragments, which satisfy a particular constraint relating to a particular geometric entity. Each plan fragment changes the configuration of a geometric entity in space--i.e. the location and orientation--satisfying a constraint and reducing a degree of freedom. The series of plan fragments which reduce the degrees of freedom and satisfy the constraints comprise an assembly plan for possible configurations of the system. The method identifies overconstrained, fully constrained, and underconstrained systems to the user and assists in finding possible configurations if the constraints are changed, added, or deleted. The method is useful in solving any geometric constraint problem, such as describing mechanical assemblies constraint-based sketching and design, geometric modeling for CAD, and kinematic analysis of robots and linkage mechanisms. By reasoning symbolically about the geometry of the system, the method provides faster solutions, numerical stability, user feedback, and the ability to handle redundant constraints. |Method for solving geometric constraint systems|A|25|0.0|0

Bandwidth-efficient modulations employ information on both phases of the carrier, and for high-order signaling alphabets, it becomes problematic to realize Direct-Conversion transceivers for which adequate gain balance between I and Q channels throughout the transmit and receive chains. For heterodyne transceivers I-Q balance is often less of an issue, by contrast, because most of the required gain operates at an Intermediate Frequency. In both cases, the trend toward lower supply voltages further exacerbates this problem because of the poorer control of analog parameters at low voltage.

Echo signals are created in response to Doppler pulses that are transmitted into the patient at a rate less than a desired PRF. The echo signals are analyzed in the time domain to determine a velocity of scatterers in an area of tissue defined by a range gate. From the velocity, the Doppler shift of the scatterers is determined. The echo signals are interpolated to produce a number of samples equal in number to that which would have been produced had the Doppler pulses been transmitted at the user-requested PRF. The interpolated echo signals are then analyzed in the frequency domain which produces a number of spectra indicative of the velocity and direction of the moving scatterers. From the Doppler shift determined, the correct spectra is selected and displayed for a user. In addition, the present invention can be used to increase the amplitude of the pulses transmitted into a patient by lowering the transmit pulse frequency so that the total amount of ultrasonic energy delivered to the patient remains the same.

This system uses equipment which is becoming standard in automobiles, such as on-board navigation systems and cellular telephones. On-board navigation systems use global positioning system (GPS) satellites to position the automobile with respect to streets in a map database. As the automobile moves, the navigation system updates the location. A central database includes travel time information for each street segment and transition between street segments in the map database. Based upon the travel time information in the database, a route from a current location to a desired destination, or series of destinations, can be planned in order to have a minimum travel time. The route can be provided to the on-board navigation system, which then directs the driver in traveling the route. The cellular telephone in the automobile can be used for communicating with the central database to obtain travel times for route planning. In order to provide dynamic travel time information to the central database, each automobile in the system operates as a data collector. As various street segments are traversed, the travel time for each segment is recorded. The travel time and street segment information is periodically transferred to the central database through the cellular telephone connection. The central database then combines the travel time data from each automobile to create accurate travel time data for each street segment. |Automobile navigation system with dynamic traffic data|A|32|0.0|0

The ""lash"" of the engine brake is the ""at rest"" clearance between engine brake slave piston and the engine exhaust valve mechanism operated on by the slave piston to produce engine braking. Engine exhaust noise associated with engine braking is reduced by reducing this lash or clearance so the engine brake opens exhaust valves in the engine at lower engine cylinder pressures, thereby reducing the associated exhaust noise. Despite the reduced exhaust noise, the engine brake still provides a substantial amount of engine braking horsepower.

The remote locations simultaneously share a channel and there is a high degree of immunity to channel impairments. At each remote location, data to be transmitted is coded by translating each group of one or more bits of the data into a transform coefficient associated with a frequency in a particular subset of orthonormal baseband frequencies allocated to each remote location. The particular subset of orthonormal baseband frequencies allocated to each location is chosen from a set of orthonormal baseband frequencies. At each remote location, an electronic processor performs an inverse orthogonal transform (e.g., an inverse Fourier Transform) on the transform coefficients to obtain a block of time domain data. The time domain data is then modulated on a carrier for transmission to the central location. Preferably, the time intervals for data transmission at the different remote locations are aligned with each other. In one embodiment of the invention, all of the baseband frequencies are allocated to a single particular remote location for one time slot. At the remote location, data is received from a plurality of remote locations. The data is demodulated to obtain baseband time domain data. The orthogonal transform is performed on this data to obtain transform coefficients. Each transform coefficient is associated with a baseband frequency. The central location keeps track of which baseband frequencies are allocated to which remote location for subsequent translation of each transform coefficient. |Multiple user access method using OFDM|A|2|0.0|1

The method operates in a conventional unicast network architecture comprised of conventional network links and unicast gateways and routers. The hosts send messages containing destination group addresses by unicast to the group messaging servers. The group addresses select message groups maintained by the group messaging servers. For each message group, the group messaging servers also maintain a list of all of the hosts that are members of the particular group. In its most simple implementation, the method consists of the group server receiving a message from a host containing a destination group address. Using the group address, the group messaging server then selects a message group which lists all of the host members of the group which are the targets of messages to the group. The group messaging server then forwards the message to each of the target hosts. In an interactive application, many messages will be arriving at the group server close to one another in time. Rather than simply forward each message to its targeted hosts, the group messaging server aggregates the contents of each of messages received during a specified time period and then sends an aggregated message to the targeted hosts. The time period can be defined in a number of ways. This method reduces the message traffic between hosts in a networked interactive application and contributes to reducing the latency in the communications between the hosts. |Server-group messaging system for interactive applications|A|6|0.0|1

A shadow public key system is an unescrowed public key system that is publicly displayed in a covert fashion. The key generated by the method are auto-recoverable and auto-certifiable (abbrev. ARC). The ARC Cryptosystem is based on a key generation mechanism that outputs a public/private key pair, and a certificate of proof that the key was generated according to the algorithm. Each generated public/private key pair can be verified efficiently to be escrowed properly by anyone. The verification procedure does not use the private key. Hence, the general public has an efficient way of making sure that any given individual's private key is escrowed properly, and the trusted authorities will be able to access the private key if needed. Since the verification can be performed by anyone, there is no need for a special trusted entity, known in the art as a ""trusted third party"". The cryptosystem is overhead free since there is no additional protocol interaction between the user who generates his or her own key, and the certification authority or the escrow authorities, in comparison to what is required to submit the public key itself in regular certified public key systems. Furthermore, the system is designed so that its internals can be made publicly scrutinizable (e.g., it can be distributed in source code form).

It is based on the task of providing an inventive solution for filling machines of the procedure, allowing the dosing of free-flowing media into containers within an exact time regime. The task is solved by the filling media moving through the filling pump, flowing passed a flow sensor in a filling media flow, with the flow speed being measured and transmitted to a regulator in which the set value is stored which is then compared with the actual value measured in the flow sensor. To adapt the actual value to the set value, the output of the filling pump is changed until the actual and set values of the flow speed correspond. With the thus exactly determined flow speed, the filling flow of the filling media arrives at the starting sensor arranged at the outlet opening of the filling pipe and activates the sensor by flowing through a sensor section. The starting sensor is connected to a counter, counting time cycles via a time interval, thus enabling the time control of the filling volume. |Process and device for dosing free-flowing media|A|5|0.0|0
